# Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation

## Overview

Welcome to the Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation Project! This is an open-source, experimental project aimed at exploring various strategies in the classic game theory puzzle known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. The goal is to create a comprehensive simulation environment where multiple strategies can be tested, compared, and evolved over time.

The project is currently under development as a personal experiment.

## Current Features

- **Simulation Engine:** A Python-based simulation engine that allows for pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma games.
- **Strategy Implementation:** A variety of predefined strategies.
- **Metrics and Analysis:** Detailed analytics for each strategy, including total score, cooperation rate, win rate, and more.

## Future Development

- **NxN Strategy Simulations:** Expand the simulation to accommodate NxN strategy interactions, allowing for more complex and dynamic simulations with multiple players interacting simultaneously, modelling more accurately what happens in the real world.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** Interest to integrate reinforcement learning, to evolve and optimize strategies based on game outcomes (need help!).

## How to Contribute

Any contributions welcome! If you have a strategy or an idea you'd like to test, here's how you can contribute:

- **Submitting Strategies:**
  - **Current Method:** Send a Pull Request (PR) or open a GitHub issue with your proposed strategy.
  - **Future Method:** If any interest is shown, I will move the strategies to a separate, imported folder, making it easier to contribute.
- **Code Contributions:** Feel free to contribute to the codebase, whether it's improving the simulation engine, adding new features, or fixing bugs.
- **Documentation:** Help in improving documentation, anything really.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the repo to your local machine.
2. **Set Up Your Environment:** Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages (e.g. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4. **Run a Simulation:** Run the notebook.
5. **Experiment:** Experiment with existing strategies or contribute your own.
