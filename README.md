# Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation Project! This is an open-source, experimental project aimed at exploring various strategies in the classic game theory puzzle known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. Our goal is to create a comprehensive simulation environment where multiple strategies can be tested, compared, and evolved over time.

The project is currently under development, and we're excited about its potential to provide insights into decision-making, strategy formulation, and game theory.

## Current Features

- **Simulation Engine:** A Python-based simulation engine that allows for pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma games.
- **Strategy Implementation:** A variety of predefined strategies, including classic ones like Tit for Tat, Always Cooperate, and Always Defect.
- **Metrics and Analysis:** Detailed analytics for each strategy, including total score, cooperation rate, win rate, and more.

## Future Development

- **NxN Strategy Simulations:** We aim to expand the simulation to accommodate NxN strategy interactions, allowing for more complex and dynamic simulations with multiple players interacting simultaneously.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** Plans to integrate machine learning, specifically reinforcement learning, to evolve and optimize strategies based on game outcomes.
- **Enhanced Analytics:** Advanced statistical analysis and visualization tools for deeper insights into strategy performance and dynamics.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Development of an interactive web interface for users to experiment with different strategies and view real-time results.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from enthusiasts, researchers, and students! If you have a strategy or an idea you'd like to test, here's how you can contribute:

- **Submitting Strategies:**
  - **Current Method:** Send a Pull Request (PR) or open a GitHub issue with your proposed strategy.
  - **Future Method:** We are working on a system to allow strategies to be imported from a separate folder, making it easier to contribute.
- **Code Contributions:** Feel free to contribute to the codebase, whether it's improving the simulation engine, adding new features, or fixing bugs.
- **Documentation:** Help in improving documentation, writing tutorials, or creating educational content is always valuable.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the repo to your local machine.
2. **Set Up Your Environment:** Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages.
4. **Run a Simulation:** Follow the instructions in the documentation to run your first simulation.
5. **Experiment:** Experiment with existing strategies or contribute your own.

## Contributing Guidelines

- **Code Style:** Please adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- **Documentation:** All contributions should be accompanied by appropriate documentation.
- **Testing:** New code should come with tests to verify its functionality.

## Community
